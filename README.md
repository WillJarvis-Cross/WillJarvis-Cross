## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm William Jarvis-Cross, a passionate software developer from Toronto. I specialize in cloud development, and I'm currently working on attaining AWS cloud certifications and cloud-based projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a full-stack web application, NoteGenius, enabling students to upload and manage class notes. It is integrated with AWS Amplify, Cognito, and S3 for secure authentication, file storage, and automatic deployment. It implements AI features using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector databases for generating practice tests and answering questions based on user-submitted content.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning content for the AWS solutions architect associate certification
